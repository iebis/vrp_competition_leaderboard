# TLM Vehicle Routing Competition

Welcome to the TLM Vehicle Routing Competition, linked to Assignment 2 of the TLM course!

In this competition, you can earn bonus points by designing well-performing algorithms for the vehicle routing problem. All communication of this competition goes via GitHub Issues in **THIS** repository. If you have questions or comments related to the competition, please open an `Issue` in this GitHub repository.

## Competition rules and guidelines

1. We trust you to do your best to learn how to design well-performing algorithms by yourself, without cheating. Note that we will check the code of the winning group and some randomly selected groups.
2. If you submit code before 12:00 midnight, your solution will run and the next day the leaderboard will be updated with your score.
3. All submissions go via GitHub Classroom.
4. You can only use the Python libraries listed in `main.py`, consult with us if you like to use other libraries.
5. Please do not upload code with bugs.
6. All communication concerning the competition goes via GitHub Issues. Please do not send e-mails to any of us regarding the competition.
7. The competition consist of 2 rounds, with in each round a winning team.
8. Scores are determined based on the solutions with the least distance (90% weight in round 1, 60% weight in round 2) and computational times (10% in round 1, 40% in round 2)
9. We limit the computational time to 15 minutes per day per group. If you did not find a solution within 15 minutes, your submission is invalid.
10. Only your best scoring solution is shown on the leaderboard. 
11. After submitting, it might take some time before your score appears on the leaderboard, depending on the length of the queue of submissions.
12. Code runs on a virtual machine with an Intel Xeon Gold 5118 CPU (1 thread) at 2.30GHz and 4GB RAM.
13. No rights can be derived from this information and the leaderboard at any moment in time.

# Provisional Leaderboard

No rights can be derived from below leaderboard, at the end of the competition rounds the definite leaderboard will be published by us. Note that a lower score is better and that `Passed` indicates if your solution ran without bugs and finished within the timelimit of 15 minutes.
